# Getting Started With Dashboards

Improve the dashboard with the use of dashboard objects like containers and dashboard actions, 
which add interactivity.


## Creating dashboards
Interactive dashboards combine and present data dynamically to measure businees performance and
inform business strategy. By combining worksheets in one centralized place can show perspectives
that are not visible otherwise.

## Getting started
Make sure that the dashboard makes use of the entire space available in the window. Set the size
to automatic. If you dont want to scroll down worksheets you can fit them entire view. You
can use each worksheet as filters. It doesn't effect only the dashboard. Also you can add
worksheets to tooltips.

## Adding elements to the dashboard
To add annotation right click on the map and from annotate select area. A text can be added from
the objects section. It can be either added to the dashboard or on the map. To add dynamic titles
to the dashboards can be created with a new worksheet by using filters and pages shelf. To make
it transparent Format > shading > worksheet > None

## Dashboard objects and actions
To enhance the dashboards some objects can added. Containers can be found under the Horizontal
and vertical keywords. Containers let you group items together. 

## Working with containers
You can use the containers top clean up the dashboards, add titles, logos, and filters from the
right hand side of the dashboard. The header space is a very common place to use a container as 
you combine different types of objects in a descriptive headliner. Creating a container makes 
it easy to "load" objects into it.

## Dashboard interactivity
To add filters to the dasboards you can add filters to the sheets. To see the effects of the
filters on the tooltips make them apply to all using this data source.


# Sharing Data Insights

## Sharing data insights
Tableau's story points is one of the most effective avenues for delivering a data story. Tools
that you can use when building a visualization, such as tooltips, are also available in story points.


## Creating and formatting Story Points

Dashboards are used to build stroy points. To annotate something in the story right click and
from annotate select mark.

## Advanced manipulations with Story Points
To make legends highlight what is selected click on highlight selected items. To make two graph 
on the same scale right click on axis edit it and select fixed and indicate a number. Highlighting
works like filter but without loosing context.

## Sharing dashboards - mobile and exports

Reports can aslo be shared to the tableau mobile app and exported to different formats. But you
need optimize it first. You can export to images in  PNG, bitmap, JPG also Power Point or PDF.

## Customizing for mobile users
Phone layout is automatically generated. To preview the device, now we have device types available
in Device Preview. Height of specific graph by selecting edit height. To remove graphs select it
and right click on the corresponding item and click Remove Zone from Phone.

## Mobile navigation and export options

We can create 2 different dashboards to navigate each other instead of scrolling. We can copy
image from dashboad and clicing on copy image or export image to PNG, Bitmap or JPG. It is 
the same with the sheets. To export as a Power Point, click on the file menu item and select export
as PowerPoint.To export as a PDF navigate to print and save as pdf.
